Goal:
Create a program in Python that will read a given set of IPs, perform Geo IP and RDAP lookups, and
return the data back to the user.
Objectives:

This exercise is designed to test your ability to:

Take abstract requirements and run with them
Write isolated decoupled modules with strict input/output interfaces
Reading, parsing and extracting IP addresses from unstructured text in an efficient manner
Technical Requirements:

Each component (GeoIP/RDAP/Parsing) should be as decoupled from the others as possible
while still being easy to use.
The main function should parse a text file containing 5000 IP addresses spread throughout
random text.
Do not use 3rd party packages that provide complete solutions for GeoIP queries or RDAP
queries. Libraries simplifying HTTP requests (Requests), data manipulation (JSON), etc. are
acceptable.

The application must be operational through a Command Line Interface
Please include context in your readme.md on how to setup and run your application
A method of optimization, such as caching, should be implemented. You are free to choose
any method for optimizing the HTTP requests.

Some examples of not acceptable modules. Try to use as much of your own code as
possible.
